\section{Natural Language Processing Methodology}
\label{sec:nlp_methodology}

Building on the established causal impact, we now turn to our primary contribution: a comprehensive NLP analysis of how question content, complexity, and focus have evolved in response to ChatGPT's introduction. This section outlines our NLP methodology for detecting and characterizing these changes.
