\section{Preliminary Results}
While our NLP analysis remains in progress, our causal findings suggest substantial changes in Stack Overflow usage patterns. Beyond the 26-29\% volume reduction, we observed a fundamental shift in the correlation structure between Stack Exchange forums after ChatGPT's release, as visualized in Figure \ref{fig:correlation_matrix}.

This dramatic weakening of correlations (from 0.76-0.87 to 0.18-0.65) suggests that ChatGPT has reduced question volume but potentially altered the relationship between programming questions and those in other knowledge domains. This finding motivates our hypothesis that the content and nature of Stack Overflow questions have fundamentally changed in the post-ChatGPT era -â€” a hypothesis we explore through our NLP analysis in the following sections.
