	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of key variables and items in technology adoption frameworks. The study aims to identify strengths and weaknesses of different frameworks and provide recommendations for future research and best practices for implementation of technology adoption frameworks. The literature review reveals that the most commonly used technology adoption frameworks are the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework, Task Technology Fit (TTF), and Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT). The study is significant as it will provide insights into factors influencing technology adoption and help researchers and practitioners better understand the adoption process. The study utilized a systematic literature review approach and identified 50 relevant articles published between 2012 and 2023. The findings revealed several key variables and items in technology adoption frameworks, including perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention, organizational context, task compatibility, user skills, user involvement, communication, and innovation characteristics. The comparison of variables and items across frameworks highlighted overlaps and unique aspects of each framework, with some frameworks being more comprehensive than others. The study’s findings have practical implications for organizations considering technology adoption, and can contribute to the development of more effective technology adoption frameworks that address the complexities of adoption in various contexts.},

	abstract = {This study develops and empirically tests a theoretical model of artificially intelligent (AI) device use acceptance (AIDUA) that aims to explain customers’ willingness to accept AI device use in service encounters. The proposed model incorporates three acceptance generation stages (primary appraisal, secondary appraisal, and outcome stage) and six antecedents (social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and emotion). Utilizing data collected from potential customers, the proposed AIDUA model is tested. Findings suggest that customers go through a three-step acceptance generation process in determining whether to accept the use of AI devices during their service interactions. Findings indicate that social influence and hedonic motivation are positively related to performance expectancy while anthropomorphism is positively related to effort expectancy. Both performance and effort expectancy are significant antecedents of customer emotions, which determines customers’ acceptance of AI device use in service encounters. This study provides a conceptual AI device acceptance framework that can be used by other researchers to better investigate AI related topics in the service context.},

	abstract = {Q\&amp;A platforms have been crucial for the online help-seeking behavior of programmers. However, the recent popularity of ChatGPT is altering this trend. Despite this popularity, no comprehensive study has been conducted to evaluate the characteristics of ChatGPT's answers to programming questions. To bridge the gap, we conducted the first in-depth analysis of ChatGPT answers to 517 programming questions on Stack Overflow and examined the correctness, consistency, comprehensiveness, and conciseness of ChatGPT answers. Furthermore, we conducted a large-scale linguistic analysis, as well as a user study, to understand the characteristics of ChatGPT answers from linguistic and human aspects. Our analysis shows that 52\% of ChatGPT answers contain incorrect information and 77\% are verbose. Nonetheless, our user study participants still preferred ChatGPT answers 35\% of the time due to their comprehensiveness and well-articulated language style. However, they also overlooked the misinformation in the ChatGPT answers 39\% of the time. This implies the need to counter misinformation in ChatGPT answers to programming questions and raise awareness of the risks associated with seemingly correct answers.},

Synthetic difference-in-differences can be used in a wide class of circumstances where treatment effects on some particular policy or event are desired, and repeated observations on treated and untreated units are available over time. We lay out the theory underlying SDID, both when there is a single treatment adoption date and when adoption is staggered over time, and discuss estimation and inference in each of these cases. We introduce the sdid command which implements these methods in Stata, and provide a number of examples of use, discussing estimation, inference, and visualization of results.},
