	abstract = {In this paper, we describe a computational implementation of the Synthetic difference-in-differences (SDID) estimator of Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) for Stata. Synthetic difference-in-differences can be used in a wide class of circumstances where treatment effects on some particular policy or event are desired, and repeated observations on treated and untreated units are available over time. We lay out the theory underlying SDID, both when there is a single treatment adoption date and when adoption is staggered over time, and discuss estimation and inference in each of these cases. We introduce the sdid command which implements these methods in Stata, and provide a number of examples of use, discussing estimation, inference, and visualization of results.},

	abstract = {I propose an event study extension of Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) estimators. I show that, in simple and staggered adoption designs, estimators from Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) can be disaggregated into dynamic treatment effect estimators, comparing the lagged outcome differentials of treated and synthetic controls to their pre-treatment average. Estimators presented in this note can be computed using the sdid\_event Stata package.},

	abstract = {We present a new estimator for causal effects with panel data that builds on insights behind the widely used difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods. Relative to these methods we find, both theoretically and empirically, that this "synthetic difference-in-differences" estimator has desirable robustness properties, and that it performs well in settings where the conventional estimators are commonly used in practice. We study the asymptotic behavior of the estimator when the systematic part of the outcome model includes latent unit factors interacted with latent time factors, and we present conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality.},
