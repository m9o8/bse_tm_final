        This study investigates how ChatGPT's release has transformed question patterns on Stack Overflow, combining causal inference with text mining to measure both quantitative and qualitative impacts. Applying the Technology Acceptance Model framework, we analyze how ChatGPT's perceived usefulness and ease of use have reshaped developers' information-seeking behavior. Using a Synthetic Difference-in-Differences approach with data spanning January 2021 to March 2024, we establish that ChatGPT caused a significant 39.5\% reduction in scripting language questions (JavaScript, Python, R, and PHP). Beyond this volumetric decline, we demonstrate a statistically significant increase in question complexity following ChatGPT's introduction. Our TF-IDF analysis reveals meaningful linguistic shifts: terms related to troubleshooting and technical infrastructure increased in importance, while basic programming concepts declined significantly. These findings align with recent research suggesting developers strategically allocate questions between platforms based on perceived usefulness for specific query types. Our research provides empirical evidence of how large language models reshape knowledge-sharing dynamics in technical communities, pointing to a complementary relationship between AI tools and human-moderated forums.
